# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
  exclude:
    - build/**  # Ignore generated build files
    - .dart_tool/**  # Ignore Dart tool cache files
    - lib/generated_plugin_registrant.dart  # Ignore auto-generated plugin registration file

  errors:
    missing_required_param: error  # Prevents missing required parameters in function calls
    missing_return: error  # Ensures all functions with return types return a value
    dead_code: warning  # Highlights unused code to keep the project clean
    todo: ignore  # Allows T0D0 comments without showing warnings

formatter:
  trailing_commas: preserve # Preserves existing trailing commas in code formatting

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # ✅ Performance & Optimization
    avoid_slow_async_io: true  # Prevents using slow async operations (like File IO) in performance-critical parts
    cancel_subscriptions: true  # Ensures streams are closed properly to avoid memory leaks
    close_sinks: true  # Avoids potential memory leaks by ensuring sinks are properly closed
    use_rethrow_when_possible: true  # Ensures proper exception rethrowing for debugging accuracy
    prefer_final_in_for_each: true  # Prevents modifying loop variables unexpectedly
    unnecessary_await_in_return: true  # Avoids unnecessary `await` in return statements, improving performance

    # ✅ Best Practices
    always_use_package_imports: true  # Enforces using `package:` imports instead of relative imports for consistency
    avoid_classes_with_only_static_members: true  # Encourages using top-level functions instead of unnecessary classes
    avoid_print: true  # Replaces print statements with proper logging (use `debugPrint` or `logger` package)
    avoid_relative_lib_imports: true  # Prevents messy imports; use `package:` instead
    prefer_const_constructors: true  # Encourages using `const` constructors where possible for efficiency
    prefer_const_declarations: true  # Encourages `const` for immutable variables to improve performance
    prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables: true  # Optimizes UI elements by making lists/maps immutable
    prefer_final_fields: true  # Ensures class fields are final unless necessary, improving immutability
    use_super_parameters: true  # Uses `super.param` for cleaner constructors (Flutter 3+)
    use_key_in_widget_constructors: true  # Encourages adding `Key` to widgets for better performance in widget trees

    # ✅ Code Readability & Style
    prefer_single_quotes: true  # Enforces single quotes for consistency (`'text'` instead of `"text"`)
    always_put_required_named_parameters_first: false  # Improves function readability by placing required params first
    sort_child_properties_last: true  # Keeps widget child properties last for better readability
    prefer_expression_function_bodies: false  # Shortens one-liner functions using `=>`
    omit_local_variable_types: false  # Allows using `var` where the type is obvious, making code cleaner
    unnecessary_lambdas: false  # Removes redundant lambda functions to improve readability

    # ✅ Flutter-Specific Improvements
    avoid_unnecessary_containers: true  # Prevents wrapping widgets in unnecessary `Container`s
    always_declare_return_types: true  # Enforces specifying return types in functions for clarity
    use_setters_to_change_properties: true  # Encourages using setters instead of exposing fields directly
    prefer_typing_uninitialized_variables: true  # Encourages specifying types for uninitialized variables for clarity
